- Choose 2 apis from the [Github Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that require authentication keys or OAuth keys and integrate them to your own api enpoints that you can ping through requests on your Django Project
- Choose 2 free apis from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and fully integrate them to your own api endpoints that you can ping through requests on your Django Project
